# rca-tripartite-network-recommendation
# We omitted the data processing part and directly demonstrated the construction of the network using pre-processed data.


# ‘RCA tripartite net-rs.ipynb’ includes:the establishment of the user-program RCA matrix, the program-channel network matrix, the NBI algorithm, the CF algorithm and the calculation of Ranking Score.

# # ‘CF-Calculation intersection-conjunction score matrix.py’:Calculate the audience intersection/conjunction of two programs. The input data is the list of viewers for each program. Due to the large size of the matrix, a multi-process approach is used to make the computation.
